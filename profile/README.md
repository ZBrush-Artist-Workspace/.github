## What is ZBrush?

ZBrush Sculpting Environment is designed for artists working with zbrush and pixologic zbrush workflows. It supports detailed character modeling, concept sculpting, and intricate surface creation through an optimized 3D sculpting toolset.

The platform incorporates maxon zbrush capabilities, enabling creators to shape, refine, and detail meshes using brush for zbrush methods. These functions make it suitable for complex sculpting tasks and high-resolution design projects.

ZBrush also supports structured sculpting pipelines through zbrush artist utilities and painting in zbrush techniques. These features allow for efficient stroke management, texturing passes, and layered surface definition.

Its system integrates zbrush 3d printing and polygroup zbrush functions, helping artists organize assets, segment models, and prepare geometry for physical output or digital rendering environments.

Users benefit from zbrush interface and zbrush noisemaker elements that streamline workflow customization and surface pattern design. This makes the environment suitable for stylized sculpting or detailed mechanical forms.

ZBrush further includes advanced sculpting modules such as sculptris pro, zbrush sculptris, and zbrush sculptris pro, offering dynamic mesh editing without traditional topology constraints. It adapts to a wide range of creative requirements.
